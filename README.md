# SYA
SYA is a [Shunting Yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting_yard_algorithm) wrote in Rust with a Token Parser (Lexer) included.

The Algorithm first converts the Expression into  [Reverse Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation) (**RPN**):

The algorithm then traverses through the **RPN**, everytime an operator is found the operation is applied in the two previous numbers:

>(2+4) â‹… (4+6) with RPN 24 + 46 + â‹…

The remaining number in the stack should be the result of the expression. ðŸ¦€
